If you are a teacher grading a bunch of quizzes that all have a certain number of points, and you want to write a percentage grade on each student's paper, this program is for you. It's short and simple, enter the total number of points on the quiz/test and the program gives you a table indicating the percentage grade for each "points off" value, in quarter points.
